# C-Projects 🖥️💻

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects that demonstrate various concepts, such as user management systems, banking systems, games, and utilities. These projects are designed to help improve problem-solving skills and demonstrate practical applications of C programming.

## 🚀 Projects Included:

1. **User Management System** 🧑‍💼
   - A basic user management system that allows creating, modifying, deleting, and viewing user details. 
   - Can be extended to include authentication, user roles, and more.

2. **Bank Management System** 💵🏦
   - A simple banking system to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and list all accounts.

3. **Calculator** 🧮
   - A basic calculator that supports arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4. **Clock** ⏰
   - A digital clock implemented using C that displays the current time.

5. **Number Guessing Game** 🎮
   - A fun game where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

6. **Progress Bar** 🏁
   - A terminal-based progress bar that simulates the completion of tasks with visual feedback.

## 📋 Features Across Projects:

- **File Handling**: Many projects use file handling to store and retrieve data, such as user details and account information.
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Each project offers a simple, text-based menu to interact with the system.
- **Basic C Functions**: All projects are implemented using basic C language features, such as loops, conditionals, functions, and structures.

## ⚙️ How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository** or **Download the Files**:
   - Clone the repository using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/sudhanshu9508/C-Projects.git
     ```

2. **Compile the C Code**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project is located.
   - Compile the C code using GCC or any other C compiler:
     ```bash
     gcc -o project_name project_name.c
     ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   - On Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     ./project_name
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     project_name.exe
     ```

4. **Follow the on-screen instructions** to interact with each program.

## 🧰 Technologies Used:

- **Programming Language**: C
- **File Handling**: Used to store and manage data in files (e.g., user details, bank account information).
- **Time Functions**: Used in projects like the clock and progress bar for simulating real-time events.
